This repository contain the 2 files 'scripts.py' with the solutions for the hankerrank problems and the 'stamps' contains 
the screenshot of the submissions and their scores displayed on user profile at [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)

The python solutions in the file are arranged on the format given below,the subdivision parts
under each top is not listed here. They are highlighted with h3 heading in the py file and follows 
the same order as in the workplace [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
